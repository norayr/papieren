teaching
========

i keep notes with source code in public repositories on github.

notes for every year differ, but these are the examples:

[computer organization 2021 notes](https://github.com/comporg21/notes)

[compiler design 2019 notes](https://github.com/compilers2019/notes)

[operating systems 2017 notes](https://github.com/osdevnet/BBS/tree/master/notes)

[network programming 2025 notes](https://github.com/networks2025/BBS/tree/main)

in order to explain students some networking concepts i have been written

* [vpn server and client](https://github.com/norayr/xoxovpn)
* [RSA library](https://github.com/norayr/rsa)

also already had other network related projects in my repositories.

repositories contain many references to troublespots and loopholes in language design.

i feel a need to explain why we need type checks [across module boundaries](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/tree/master/make/c) (modules existed since late 70ies, added to c++ standard in 2020).

[this video](https://outcast.am/w/5MZquU8m5EhGs7dcm2g9sB) illustrates the issues. also available [here](https://toobnix.org/w/pvXmf72qNiqxDfpqGMRgmp).

why c# namespaces [don't solve](https://github.com/compilers2019/notes/tree/master/5/namespace) the problems c has.

on [fortran](https://github.com/compilers2019/notes/blob/master/5/note) problem.

on floating point accuracy problems [here](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/blob/master/currency_bcd/notes). also [this](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/blob/master/currency_bcd/imtec-92-26.pdf) pdf.

on arrays vs linked lists performance [here](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/tree/master/arrays_linked_lists)

on [endianness](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/tree/master/endianness) problems, like when typcasting.

on [buffer overflows](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/tree/master/stack/gets)

on [how by changing one byte in memory make function exit not to caller but to different location](https://github.com/comporg21/notes/tree/master/stack/stack_smashing/2)

on [getting values out of array index range](https://github.com/compilers2019/notes/blob/master/5/arr.c) which caused heartbleed bug in openssl library.

and [this](https://github.com/norayr/troublespots) is a small forgotten repo about c++.
