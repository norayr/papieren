compiler related
=========

i was interested in compilers already long ago, let's say [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nmos6502-oo2c/files/) is my port of oo2c oberon compiler to nmos6502 cpu based platforms, published in 2007.
[it](https://github.com/norayr/nmos6502-oo2c) is customized to generate 6502 code by using cc65.

* avr oberon-07
[this](https://github.com/norayr/oberon-07_avr_oo2c) is a port of oberon-07 compiler for avr which was running under A2 operating system to Linux or Windows host system by using oo2c compiler.

more serious:

* o7c, x86 backend, done during 200{7,8} work at ETHZ:

[o7c compiler](https://github.com/norayr/o7c)

i also prepared a minimal runtime library for it, and some tests.

[these](https://github.com/norayr/o7c/tree/master/tests) are some tests.

[this](https://github.com/norayr/o7c/blob/master/tests/hello/Unix.mod) illustrates how i used kernel calls directly, bypassing libc.

[this](https://github.com/norayr/o7c/tree/master/tests/hellolibc) illustrates how i used libc for the same purpose.

* vishap oberon


[vishap organization](https://github.com/vishapoberon/) github page.

[voc](https://github.com/vishapoberon/compiler).

take a look at the [trace](http://norayr.am/files/2013-12-18/graph_dot.svg) on how voc compiles hello world file.

firstly, port to 64bit system was made, then addition of HUGEINT 64bit type, SYSTEM.ADDRESS - which is pointer size on every platform, cleanup of code of memory manager, bufixes in code generator, changes in symbol table handling.

voc has [tests](https://github.com/vishapoberon/compiler/tree/master/src/test/) directory.

there is my forking server, sound generation example, vt100 module, and [games](https://github.com/vishapoberon/compiler/tree/master/src/test/x11) ported from classical oberon system via x11 wrapper.

click [here](http://norayr.am/oberon/voc/test.png) to see how tetris port looks. ([original archived blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170515222247/http://oberon.vishap.am/169-2/))

[here](http://norayr.am/oberon/voc/gtk.png) to see how gtk app looks, which is written in oberon.

[vipack](https://github.com/vishapoberon/vipack) package manager.
it is able to recoursively calculate dependencies, and download those via git or http or https.

started as a [student project](http://norayr.am/papers/Thesis_Ruben_Khachatryan_CIS_2019.pdf) i revised.

later i implemented recoursive dependency resolver, the graph is on the screenshot by the link.

i have also enhanced the project with [oberon http library](https://github.com/norayr/http), [mbedtls wrapper for https](https://github.com/norayr/mbedtls), [base64 module](https://github.com/norayr/base64), and ported [md5 module](https://github.com/vishapoberon/compiler/blob/master/src/library/s3/ethMD5.Mod) from oberon system.

[vpicl](https://github.com/vishapoberon/vpicl)


this was just port of wirth's pic16f84 compiler. [screenshot](http://norayr.am/oberon/voc/vpicl__.png) at the page shows how the code generated by it executes in gpsim simulator.

voc is currently used in a ['freeoberon' ide](https://github.com/kekcleader/FreeOberon), not my project.


chromatika
==========

chromatika is an android app which will apply carefully and scientifically generated color profiles (LUTs) to your photos, to make them look like film. we used 2 different Kodak and 2 different Fuji film properties to create these LUTs.

chromatika is written from scratch in Pascal and is crossplatform. It can be compiled for android and ios.

etiquette
=========

[etiquette](https://github.com/norayr/etiquette) - tags for linux filesystems by using extended attributes.

demo: [here](https://outcast.am/w/748yNuYn2ZbeaQ5Ps7RRMP) or [here](https://toobnix.org/w/43z3xJSwZRU2iBNZPZkChv) you can see how it works.

for this program i had to also write two dependencies:
* [xattr module](https://github.com/norayr/xattr) - currently linux specific wrapper to xattr interface.
* [unix file system](https://github.com/norayr/unixFileSystem/) - works on every unix, not onli linux.



irc
===

i have written this [irc bot](https://github.com/norayr/irc_bot) from scratch in oberon.

first [internet sockets wrapper](https://github.com/norayr/Internet/),
then  [irc protocol](https://github.com/norayr/irc/) implementation,

i also used other libraries or wrappers written by me, like [lists](https://github.com/norayr/lists) library for linked lists, [opts](https://github.com/norayr/opts) to parse commandline arguments, or very simple [unix time](https://github.com/norayr/lists/tree/4fec82f839b088e8cf6b640816b61ba8a2129c69) wrapper.

photography related
===================
* above mentioned [photolightmeter](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/photolightmeter)

* [chromatika](https://github.com/chromatika/chromatika)

xmpp
====

contribution to the xmpp library written in pascal.
made crossplatform (to compile with lazarus) and added two methods, which were not implemented(i guess to get the avatar image from the server, and something else)

[commit link](https://github.com/devi/uxmpp/commit/1ffe8020590b76542d82c757228729a8ff65cb77)

this was done for my decentralized location sharing linux [mobile application](http://norayr.am/meridian23/).
first gif at that page shows how i approach synopsys building.

freepascal
==========

bug fix in 2010, originally reported on their mantis, trace is on [freepascal gitlab](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/issues/18239) — longi should be smalli in interbase.pp file.

it did not build on my aarch64 pinebook, so i patched the ebuild:
[link](https://gentoobrowse.randomdan.homeip.net/packages/dev-lang/fpc) and other [link](https://bugs.gentoo.org/817899)

i also provided [this patch](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/documentation/-/issues/21107) in 2010.

reported:
[this issue](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/issues/25715) — getaddrinfo,freeaddrinfo, getaddrinfoex, getaddrinfow, gai_strerror and corresponding error codes and structures are missing in WinSock2 unit.

[this issue](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/issues/25714) — error codes of function getaddrinfo in cnetdb.pp unit do not correspond to the /usr/include/netdb.h header file.


maemo-leste
===========

as a result of discussion in #maemo-leste irc room, i did [this project](https://github.com/norayr/gen-header-for-hildon-input-method) to generate a header which will be used by maemo keyboard.

the [resulting header](https://github.com/norayr/gen-header-for-hildon-input-method/blob/master/out.h) contains two arrays: one of unicode codes, other for x key symbols.

it is generated by comparing [one of node files](https://github.com/substack/node-keysym/blob/master/data/keysyms.txt) with xorg [keysimdef.h](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/keysymdef.h) file.

this is [the commit](https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-input-method/commit/5dcba543c36c12ac70288a7b652310e275eebee7), which mentions me as inky (one of my irc nicknames).

brought extra keyboards (mentioned [here](https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-thirteenth-update-april-may-june-2020.html) to the project from the other, outdated project, this is the [pull request](https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-input-method-plugins/pull/2) - this is nothing serious, but required skills to build the debian packages, edit makefiles, to make sure the new keyboards are registered in gconf and can be loaded via ui.

i also have a mobile linux application in maemo repos: [photolightmeter](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/photolightmeter) - it calculates aperture and shutter settings for old manual film cameras. initially written for [n900](https://www.my-maemo.com/software/applications_name_Photographic_Light_Meter_faq_36_fldAuto_2240.html)

the only interesting part there is that [i get](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/photolightmeter/blob/c707d055b76bcf56c2e1ea1a60575abb50548bed/lux.pas#L71) amount of light in lux by finding and analyzing driver files right in /sys directory.

i have published `android` port of the same program, compiled with delphi community edition:

[binary on play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embarcadero.photolightmeter&gl=US)

[source code branch on github](https://github.com/norayr/photolightmeter/tree/android)

the difference is how do i get the ambient light sensor information, this time by just [using a delphi class](https://github.com/norayr/photolightmeter/blob/ad36dabfa598d7badd6f98333af0cbcf2fc3ea86/lux.pas#L190).

maemo-leste ports & maintainership
==================================

my apps:

* [comics-daily](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/comics-daily)

[comics-daily](https://github.com/norayr/comics-daily) is a linux app to read/scrape/download comicses from gocomics.com.

it is in maemo leste repos. i use it every day.
[this is the blog post](https://norayr.am/weblog/2024/07/15/24165919/) in which i present it.

I have enriched maemo-leste repositories by the following projects, which I mostly revived and brought to back to life, and sometimes ported/packaged (see git histories).

ports:

* [Amazfish](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/harbour-amazfish) - watch app and daemon.

* it also required porting [nemo-qml-plugin-dbus](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus) package.

* [lagrange](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/lagrange) - packaged SDL based mobile ui version of lagrange for mobile Linux. Usually Linux packagers package the desktop version, and only Android and IOS builds made by author use mobile ui.

revived applications:

* [live-wallpaper](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/live-wallpaper) is a maemo control panel applet.

* [shermans-aquarium-maemo](https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/shermans-aquarium-maemo) is one of the plugins for live-wallpaper.

It is derived from the other old program [published on sourceforge](http://aquariumapplet.sourceforge.net/). That program didn't build for a long time, so I fixed and published it:

* [sherman's aquarium revived](https://github.com/norayr/shermans_aquarium)

for the windowmaker dockapp to work I also had to bring to life GAI library.

* [GAI](https://github.com/norayr/gai)

the build instructions are [here](https://github.com/norayr/shermans_aquarium/blob/main/readme.noch)

demos [here](https://toobnix.org/w/fCvuWkr7Ciny8FqLsBmc9t) and [here](https://toobnix.org/w/4kYj2HT4kfy3wPEY5feNUY)
